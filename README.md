# Android Programming Final Assignment
Project made by me

## Course Description
- In this course I learned how to program Android in Java using Android Studio.
- This app also relies on an esp32 connected with MQTT, some led's and buttons. The code is not included in this repository.
- This app uses MQTT to communicate between some lights, and the app. In the app you can control the 4 LED's connected to the esp32. You can also control the LED's using the push buttons connected on the esp32. There is also logging in the app, so you can see the time and which LED turned to what color.
